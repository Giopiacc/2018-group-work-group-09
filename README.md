## ABOUT THE PROJECT

Our project is about the discover of Dark Matter. What’s Dark Matter? We don’t know, we only have been exposed to theories. But the main point of this project is to show that actually is something unknown. Dark matter is something that permeate the universe, but remains unseen and hard to define. It does not reflect the light, so we are not able to detect it with our instruments.

But how the scientists discovered the presence of Dark Matter? Back in the XV Century Kepler figured out that the farther a planet is from the sun slower it orbits. This was valid also for galaxies. It became one of his very important three laws of […] Moreover he was able to calculate the gravity of a celestial bodies and finally get their mass.
Many years after scientist Vera Rubin observed that in many galaxies, the farer out from the center you went the faster the gas clouds were moving. Furthermore there was not enough mass far out from the center to influence and cause the rapid rotation rates. That was bizarre. So she came to the conclusion that the stars out were feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see: the dark matter. This is a material was contributing to the gravity, something beside stars, gas and dust and she actually demonstrated there is a lot of it if we consider all the universe.

Scientists nowadays define “dark matter” a hypothetical component of matter that, unlike known matter, would not emit electromagnetic radiation and would currently be detectable only indirectly through its gravitational effects. The dark matter should constitute almost the 90% of the present mass in the universe. They also

Potential evidence of dark matter:

*Galaxy rotation (the speed of rotation should decrease with the increase in the diameter of the orbit and instead remains constant)
*Gravitational lens (the visible mass is insufficient to create a gravitational lens capable of deflecting light) 
*Light deviation (following a scientific observation it was found that the light is also diverted in areas where the masses were not visible)

-motivazioni della sua presenza
We would like to make the user live the challenge born from the observation of sensitive reality (which escapes some laws of physics studied) and that through several demonstrations has led man to ask himself a question: is there something that we can not know, see and experience and if so, what form has it? (which represents a bit the direction in which many researches are moving)

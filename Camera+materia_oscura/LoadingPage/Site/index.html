        <span class="span1"><a href="www.google.com">You are now floating</a> in the Universe!</span>

        <span class="span2">Create your own planetary system and learn more about how things move up here! To start a new galaxy PRESS YOUR MOUSE and add your planets.</span>

        <span class="span3">What can you notice?</span>

        <span class="span4">Kepler's laws say that planets move slower when they’re farther from the Sun and that the orbital velocity is affected by the planet's mass. More speed means more mass. Keep that in mind </span>

        <span class="span5">Take your time, when you’re finished, upload your galaxy by PRESSING THE SPACEBAR.</span>

        <!--        Texts that appears after the uploading with the spacebar-->

        <span class="span6">Congrats!</span>

        <span class="span7">mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... It looks like your planets don’t like Kepler’s law!
            their velocity rotation increased but the total mass didn’t change at all</span>

        <span class="span8">There’s something missing here, maybe something you can’t see with your eyes. COVER THE WEBCAM to explore the invisible!</span>

        <!--        Text that appears after webcam covered -->

        <span class="span9">A long time ago Vera Rubin noticed that everything was spinning at the same velocity and way way faster than it should, she measured that phenomenon and she saw that it happened for every galaxy. </span>

        <span class="span10">she calculated that it accounts for about 85% of matter in the Universe. Still today scientists face the great challenge of detecting and studying dark matter particles, until then the mystery of what holds galaxies together lives on. </span>
